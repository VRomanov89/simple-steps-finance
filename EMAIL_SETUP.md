## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Email system is built and ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently using Resend test domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`)
- üéØ Need to configure production domain for real user emails

## Quick Setup for Production Emails

### Option 1: Use Your Own Domain (Recommended)

1. **Add your domain to Resend:**
   - Go to [Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `simplestepsfinance.com`)

2. **Add DNS records:**
   Resend will provide DNS records to add to your domain:
   ```
   TXT _resend.simplestepsfinance.com ‚Üí "resend-verify=abc123..."
   MX simplestepsfinance.com ‚Üí feedback-smtp.resend.com
   ```

3. **Update email configuration:**
   In `/src/app/api/send-quiz-results/route.ts`, change:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Simple Steps Finance <noreply@simplestepsfinance.com>',
   ```

### Option 2: Quick Production Test (Immediate)

If you want to test with real users right now:

1. **Use Resend's shared domain:**

   ```

2. **This allows sending to any email address immediately**

### Option 3: Gmail/Google Workspace Integration

1. **Set up Google Workspace** for your domain
2. **Use Resend with your Gmail:**

   from: 'Simple Steps Finance <noreply@simplestepsfinance.com>',
   ```
